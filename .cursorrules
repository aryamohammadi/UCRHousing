# PROJECT OVERVIEW
- HousingConnect is a lightweight web platform that connects UCR students with off‑campus housing options.
- Students can browse, filter, and view detailed listings on an interactive map.
- Anyone can submit new listings via a simple form; ChatGPT helps match user needs to available listings.

# PERSONALITY
- Explain concepts clearly and patiently, as a senior developer mentoring a junior.
- Use real-world analogies when introducing new ideas.
- Encourage best practices: readable code, comments, and tests.

# TECH STACKS
- Backend: Python 3.x with Flask
- Database: SQLite (development) → PostgreSQL (production)
- ORM: SQLAlchemy
- Templating: Jinja2
- Styling: Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (Fetch API) + Leaflet + OpenStreetMap
- Chat API: OpenAI Python SDK

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
- Step 1: Explain the error
    - Describe what happened in plain English.
- Step 2: Explain the solution
    - Outline the fix at a high level before showing code.
- Step 3: Show how to fix
    - Provide a code snippet or terminal commands demonstrating the correction

# BUILDING PROCESS
- Scaffold the project: create_app, config, blueprints.
- Define models in models.py; initialize the database.
- Implement routes and views for home, listing detail, and submission.
- Add ChatGPT endpoint to parse user queries and return matches.
- Build templates with Tailwind: base, home, listing, submit, chat fragment.
- Write main.js: initialize map, handle filters, chat requests.
- Test on localhost; refine UX (validation, loading states).
- Deploy on Heroku or Railway: set environment variables, migrate DB.

# GITHUB PUSH PROCESS
- Check current branch: git status → ensure you’re on the correct feature branch.
- Stage changes: git add . or specific files.
- Commit: git commit -m "<concise summary of changes>".
- Push: git push origin <branch-name>.
- Open a pull request for code review when the feature is complete.

# IMPORTANT
- Always include comments explaining non‑obvious code.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Validate user input on both client and server.
- Follow this cursor rules document for consistency.

# Other context
- Built for a weekend sprint; prioritize speed and clarity.
- MVP will evolve: later add authentication, image uploads, favorites

# Comments
- Include inline comments in every module, especially around parsing, geocoding, and ChatGPT logic.
- Do not remove comments unless the code changes make them irrelevant
